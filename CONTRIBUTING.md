## Setup Environment

You will need a Node.js runtime in order to leverage the tooling used in
formatting the source, transpiling SCSS to CSS and capturing screenshots. A
package.json and a Dockerfile are provided toy facilitate development within a
Node.js environment on your host or in a Node.js environment within a Docker
container.

Usage of the Docker image simplifies development as all users of the Docker
image will be working from a near-identical environment such that we can all be
more confident of things working across the board. Furthermore, the Docker
image takes care of certain system-level dependencies that one would otherwise
have to install on their host themselves.

### Node.js in Docker

Prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Perform the following steps to produce the Docker image, enter into a Bash
shell and install the node.js dependencies:

1. Produce the needed image by running `make dev-image`
2. Enter a Bash shell in a container of the previously created image by running
   `make bash`
3. Install NPM packages by running `npm install`

Note that from now on, whenever we mention any `npm` or `npx` commands, we
assume that you execute these from inside a Docker container. You may enter
into a shell inside a Docker container executing `make bash`.

### Node.js on host

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If Node.js is installed, perform the following step to install the node.js
dependencies:

1. Install NPM packages by running `npm install`

## Usage

Run `npm run dev -- TEMPLATE_NAME` and fill in the directory of the
template (for example `npx run dev -- landingcorp`) in order to:

1. Start a development web server at port 8080
2. Start node-sass to watch for changes in SCSS files to convert
   those into CSS

## Add new template

In order to add a new template, refer to the [HTML5 Boilerplate][h5bp] project
as a starting point. You will find some [resources][h5bp-resources] to use as a
starting point in `node_modules/html5-boilerplate/dist` (provided that you have
first run `npm install`):

- [index.html][h5bp-indexhtml]
- [main.css][h5bp-maincss] ([README][h5bp-maincss-readme])
- [normalize.css][h5bp-normalizecss]
- [js][h5bp-js] assets
- [miscellaneous][h5bp-extend] information on `meta` tags, DNS pre-fetching,
  search engine configuration options, pingbacks, web app configuration, etc.

[h5bp-extend]: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/doc/extend.md

For an improved development experience, run `npx node-sass -w css -o css` from inside a template directory in order to continuously watch
the css directory and produce the output css files as .scss files are
updated.

## Compile CSS

Run `npx node-sass PATH_TO_INPUT_SCSS_FILE PATH_TO_OUTPUT_CSS_FILE` to compile
SCSS into CSS

## Format Source

Run `npx prettier --write .` to "prettify" source.

## Update Screenshots

The table below provides the details for the screenshots which are to be
captured for the different templates.

### Automated

Capture screenshots by running `npm run capture TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY` where
`TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY` can be substituted for the name of a subdirectory
containing the template (e.g.: "enchanted")

### Manual

Prerequisites:

- local webserver
- [Firefox][firefox] or [Chrome][chrome]/[Chromium][chromium]

> If you have Python installed you can simply run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
> for version [2.x][py-simplehttpserver] or `python -m http.server` for version
> [3.x][py-http-server] in order to start a local webserver.

Perform the following steps to manually generate screenshots for a
given template:

1. Start local webserver (for example by running `npx http-server` or `python -m http.server`)
2. Update screenshots with [Firefox](#firefox) or
   [Chrome/Chromium](#chromechromium)

#### Firefox

   clicking "Run Command" from the dev tools menu or pressing **Ctrl + Shift +
   P**)
5. Enter `:screenshot` or select "Capture full size screenshot" into the
   command prompt and save
6. Repeat for the devices listed in the table below

#### Chrome/Chromium

Open Chrome/Chromium and perform the following steps to capture
